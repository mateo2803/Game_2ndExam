# Basic game simulator in Solar2D using lua.

## Content:
The currente files build a simulator with different scenarios, there the physics of the characters are tested.
1. Sc1 is our first scenario where the inspiration was Miles Morales, that's why the jump action has more impact.
2. Sc2 is the second scenario where the inspiration was Star Wars(kind of). The bounce was modified so the character can reach the upper platforms.
3. Sc3 is the third scenario where there was no inspiration. The gravity, boonce and double jump are regular.
4. Sc4 is the fourth scenario where there was no inspiration. The gravity, boonce and double jump are regular.
